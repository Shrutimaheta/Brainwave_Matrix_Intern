# 💳 ATM Interface (Task-1)

## 💡 Project Overview

This Java-based **ATM Interface** project was developed as part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix**. The application simulates core ATM functionalities with a graphical user interface, allowing users to:

- 🔍 View account balance  
- ➕ Deposit money  
- ➖ Withdraw money  
- 🚪 Exit the session

This system provides a basic simulation of ATM-like interactions with simple UI controls.
